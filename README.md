# eSewa SDK for PHP

The **eSewa SDK for PHP** makes it easy for developers to access [eSewa] payment service in their PHP code. You can find more details in [eSewa Documentation] site.

# Getting Started
1. **Sign up for eSewa** – Before you begin, you need to sign up and retrieve your credentials from [eSewa].
2. **Minimum requirements** – To run the SDK, your system will need to meet the minimum requirements, including having **PHP >= 7.2**. We highly recommend having it compiled with the cURL extension and cURL compiled with a TLS backend (e.g., NSS or OpenSSL). We do not support outdated PHP versions.

# Installation
**Install the SDK** – Using [Composer] is the recommended way to install the eSewa SDK for PHP. The SDK is available via [Packagist] under the [`sujanshresthanet/esewa-php-sdk`][install-packagist] package.
```
composer sujanshresthanet/esewa-php-sdk
```

## Getting Help
We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and address them as quickly as possible.

* Call or Email [eSewa] for account and payment related queries.

## Quick Examples

### Create a eSewa client

```php
// require the composer autoloader.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Cixware\Esewa\Client;

// init client for development
$esewa = new Client([
    'success_url' => 'https://example.com/success.php', // callback url for success
    'failure_url' => 'https://example.com/failed.php', // callback url for failure
]);

// init client for production
$esewa = new Client([
    'is_production' => true,
    'merchant_code' => 'b4e...e8c753...2c6e8b', // retrieve from eSewa
    'success_url' => 'https://example.com/success.php', // callback url for success
    'failure_url' => 'https://example.com/failed.php', // callback url for failure
]);
```

### Make Payment
This will redirect the user to eSewa dashboard for payment processing. Once the payment is successful, it will redirect to your success URL. If the payment fails, it will redirect to your failure URL.
```php
$esewa->process('P101W201', 100, 15, 80, 50);
```
The method accepts 5 parameters.
1. `pid` A unique ID of product or item or ticket etc.
2. `amt` Amount of product or item or ticket etc
3. `txAmt` Tax amount on product or item or ticket etc. Pass `0` if Tax/VAT is not applicable.
4. `psc` The service charge (if applicable); default to `0`.
5. `pdc` The delivery charge (if applicable); default to `0`.

The `tAmt` total amount is auto calculated based on the parameters.

### Verify Payment
Transaction verification process provide you filter that identify potentially fraudulent transactions and screen against data such as the value of transaction amount etc.
```php
$status = $esewa->verify('R101', 'P101W201', 245);
if ($status->verified) {
    // verification successful
}
```
The method accepts 3 parameters.
1. `refId` A unique payment reference code generated by eSewa.
2. `oid` Product ID used on payment request.
3. `tAmt` Total payment amount (including Tax/VAT and other charges.)
